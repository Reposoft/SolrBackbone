SolrBackbone
============

Solr mapping to a Backbone Model and Collection, leaving global Backbone.Sync untouched.
The implementation has been implemented to work with the Solr 4.4.0 schemaless example core.

### Usage
Extend window.SolrBackbone.Model/Collection to your liking.

Note that this is a very young project implemented for specific needs for the Repos Authoring platform, there will be issues :)
